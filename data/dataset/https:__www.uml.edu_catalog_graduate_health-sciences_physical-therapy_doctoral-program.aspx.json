Physical therapists utilize prevention and wellness strategies in individuals at risk for developing a reduction in physical function.\n\nThe physical therapist is professionally educated in a program that synthesizes graduate study with undergraduate knowledge, and experiential learning. The graduate of the Doctor of Physical Therapy program is prepared to function as an ethical and competent practitioner who management include examination, evaluation, diagnosis, prognosis, intervention and outcomes.
